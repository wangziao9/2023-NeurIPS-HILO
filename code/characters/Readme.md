# Loading, processing and recognizing Chinese characters

The dataset can be downloaded from https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/handwriting/Download.html. We use "Gnt1.1Test" for instance. Unzip the dataset and put it under the directory assets/

load_characters.py demonstrates how the characters look like - visualize_gnt() and the statistics of the dataset - stat_gnt()

We will add code for preprocessing the characters and accuracy evaulation with a character recognition model.
